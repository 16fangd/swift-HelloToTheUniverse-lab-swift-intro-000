Let's talk about how this course is organized. Every single piece of content on our platform is called a lesson. There are two types of lessons on Learn: READMEs and Labs.

#### Labs

Labs are lessons with a coding challenge you must complete. A lab will require you to write code and submit a solution.

You'll know if a lesson on Learn is a lab by the actions the right column asks you to take. It will ask you to Fork the Lab and submit a pull request. Some of the labs are tested where there might be an action that states that you should pass all local tests.


#### Readings

READMEs are lessons that only have instructional content. They provide context and exposition on a topic by breaking concepts down. READMEs are how you learn enough to solve a lab.

All of the lessons in this course are hosted on Github and they are open-sourced. The most important thing now is for you to get a GitHub account since without it, you won't be able to go through the rest of this course.  If you don't have one, make one now. 

Once you're set up, watch the video below that explains how we go about solving coding labs on Learn.
