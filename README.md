## Course Overview 

Let's talk first about how this course is organized. Every single piece of content on our platform is called a lesson. There are two types of lessons on Learn: READMEs and Labs.

#### Labs

Labs are lessons with a coding challenge you must complete. A lab will require you to write code and submit a solution.

You'll know if a lesson on Learn is a lab by the actions the right column asks you to take. It will ask you to Fork the Lab and submit a pull request. Some of the labs are tested where there might be an action that states that you should pass all local tests.


#### Readings

Readings are lessons that only have instructional content. They provide context and exposition on a topic by breaking concepts down. Readings are how you learn enough to solve a lab.

All of the lessons in this course are hosted on Github and they are open-sourced. Github is a platform that allows people to collaborate and do version control on their code. We won't cover the specifics but you can read more [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). The most important thing now is for you to get a GitHub account since without it, you won't be able to go through the rest of this course.  If you don't have one, make one [now](github.com). 

Once you're set up, watch the video below that explains how we go about solving coding labs on Learn. This lesson itself is a lab so follow along with the steps and solve your first lab on Learn!
